# SitTet
A tetris for those who prefer emptying the dishwasher

The layout is centred on the familar black column, at the bottom are 3 rows of random squares.
At the top side though, there are cupboards, 3 each side, 2 squares high. The user decides which cupboard is for which piece by placing the first in it. (The I piece is special in some way.)

A row of random squares appears at the bottom. If a piece is formed, it starts the fly upwards. The player has to get it in the right cupboard and the right way round so that it fits without any gaps (except the first piece in the cupboard), otherwise it appears at the bottom of the screen and pushes the rows upwards.
Multiple pieces could end up flying at the same time, but they need to have a small delay so the upper most one is the playing piece.
Needs to be mobile friendly so eg. tap the piece to rotate, tap left of screen to go left and right of screen to go right.
Cursor key usage for those with a keyboard.
The items in the cupboard simply go off the screen to the left or right to make room for more pieces, but with an optional press to close the door which starts the cupboard again, meaning it can accept any type of piece.
Each piece can only have 1 cupboard at a time, so if there is a cupboard open for a piece other cupboards will reject the piece even if it is empty.

Game plays until the screen is full just like in normal tetris.
